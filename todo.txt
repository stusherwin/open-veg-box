Deployment
==========
* Hosting

General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)

Edit Individual fields
======================
* Save/add behaviour
  - Field save success indicator
  - Field validation (multiple field coordination?)
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
? Select all in add mode, only on first focus within add action
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)
* On add, should scroll page to bring row being added into view
* keydown: Enter to save, Esc to cancel
? Split out grab/highlight directives?
? Maybe add should show all fields in edit mode?
* Fix add focus - when should it stay in add mode?
* 1px wobble in product unit quantity
* Vertically centre 'edit' button
* Change background of 'edit' button on mouseover?
* Highlight/textbox border should be outside (encompass) icons on fields (address, email, tel)

Round customers
===============
* Implement 'email all' feature on Round
  - Disable email for guest users
* Erratic expand/collapse behaviour if add/remove customer enough times
* Move to postgres as sqlite not supported on Heroku?

BUGS!!!!
========
* Adding round didn't update page with new round (hitting enter on save button?)
* Deleting a round didn't update available customers, so couldn't add customers to new round
* Add/remove button icons alignment out
* Add row wasn't focused but other rows hover was as if it was focused
