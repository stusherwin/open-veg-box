Header
======
* Header takes up too much space on small browser width
* Center alignment off on home page header
* Header/home/nav structure is messy
* Inline logo svg
* Change favicon

Auth
====
* Redirect to original page on log in
* Implement JWT

Database
========
* Split out schema sql from data
* Implement sqlite backup strategy
* Hash/salt passwords in main db
* Database schema updates

Deployment
==========
* tsconfig watch: true - needed for dev but not for production - need to resolve this somehow.
* Set up SSL


General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)
* Logout button not visible on small screen
* page footer

Editing
=======
* Fix numeric rounding issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10015027/javascript-tofixed-not-rounding
* Field save success indicator
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)

Box Products
============
* Better width solution than hardcoding pixel widths in code (padding/remainders)?
* Quantity format should reflect unittype?

Round customers
===============
* 1px spacing difference when tabbing into round-customers from outside
  - also within round-customers (add?)
* Adding last customer - add control is displayed then immediately hidden
* Removing last customer - add control hidden then displayed

Bugs
====
* Sometimes have to click login button twice.
* Warning icon alignment out in Firefox/Chrome
* Row highlight flashes when editable-value canceled
* box-product-quantity edit out by 1px in Firefox
* box-products, round-customers - clicking add - ok/cancel buttons jump right to left
* Customer phone has extra top margin on small screen
* Box products seems to think column widths are wider than they should be
* row details should have constant padding
* When cancel cc-numeric by pressing Escape and click to edit again, retains previously edited value
  (blur event fires when clicking on control to edit again, so thinks it was user input)
* cc-numeric is dodgy. Make this use ngModel somehow?
* When server error happens, breaks website?

Ideas
=====
* Add warning message to guest user that data will not be kept
* Nicer error message when guest tries to send emails?
* Undo/redo
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Catch tabbing away in active-elements then handle it specifically as a tabbed-away event 
  in container components?

Tidy up
=======
* Rename editable-value-new, editable-value

TODO (now)
==========
* Prices should be integers in pence, not floating point!!
* Use trackBy with ngFor to clean up box-products
* round-customers add button not highlighted when hovering over certain area
* queryparams not whitelisted on server side
* Should be two types of orders - dynamic and historic. 
  Customer -> Order
  Round ->* Delivery ->* HistoricOrder
                     ->* HistoricProductQuantity ?
* Need to archive products/boxes not delete them (only delete if not used!)
* Add blurb/useful links to each section on home page?

* When adding, adds to end then when comes back from server is sorted.
* Sort boxes/product in select by name
* Products should added from the top, but displayed in alphabetical order when reloaded from server
  - Server API should return id of new entity
  - Page update in-memory but not refreshed from server (server API doesn't return entity list - more efficient)
  - New entity in memory should be updated with id from server

* distribute-width should maybe use document selectors to set min-width (quicker?)
* Use distribute-width on order-list page
* Make distribute-width work with tables

* Loading component (content when loaded)
* Email invalid icons out of alignment

* Add product link doesn't activate on focus? (Previously activated component doesn't deactivate)
* Cancel out of add should focus add button
* Escape should cancel out of add
* Save should start a new add
* Rename Save to OK or Add? 'Add' icon?
* Padding around add control

* Rename -new classes
* Editable value buttons
* Bottom padding on rows
* Better section/headings on Product/Order List pages

* 404 when missing server-side resource not handled
* Need 404 icon (info icon without background?)

* Tidy up providers (BoxService, ProductService etc, shared directives, pipes)

* When changing customer page, should reload customer
* Email edit font size wierdness
* Make button-new-small structure same as button-new
* Make button-new background white
* Border around button-new-small on hover
* Chrome border wierdness

Editable
========
* Enter/Esc - to exit editable
* Bug: if no properties whitelisted, get sql error
* OnDestroy: unsubscribe to observables!
* button-new: transparent background is preventing hover highlight
* send-emails - cancel button out of alignment

* Add row validation

* Section title descenders being cut off (see round Chompton & Digby)
* Fix editable-select and cc-select (getText and getValue consistency)
* Upgrade sql scripts
* Add deliveryWeekday to Round
* Deliveries server-side (copy orders)
* Prompt when re-preparing a delivery when orders have changed.
* Disable email button in section header if customer has no email address
* Delivery page blows up if delivery not found
* Completing delivery ignores delivery day if recently changed
* Remove price from historicOrderedBoxProduct
