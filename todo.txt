Header
======
* Header takes up too much space on small browser width
* Center alignment off on home page header
* Header/home/nav structure is messy
* Inline logo svg
* Change favicon

Auth
====
* Redirect to original page on log in
* Implement JWT

Database
========
* Split out schema sql from data
* Implement sqlite backup strategy
* Hash/salt passwords in main db
* Database schema updates

Deployment
==========
* tsconfig watch: true - needed for dev but not for production - need to resolve this somehow.
* Set up SSL


General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)
* Logout button not visible on small screen
* page footer

Editing
=======
* Fix numeric rounding issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10015027/javascript-tofixed-not-rounding
* Field save success indicator
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)

Box Products
============
* Better width solution than hardcoding pixel widths in code (padding/remainders)?
* Quantity format should reflect unittype?

Round customers
===============
* 1px spacing difference when tabbing into round-customers from outside
  - also within round-customers (add?)
* Adding last customer - add control is displayed then immediately hidden
* Removing last customer - add control hidden then displayed

Bugs
====
* Sometimes have to click login button twice.
* Warning icon alignment out in Firefox/Chrome
* Row highlight flashes when editable-value canceled
* box-product-quantity edit out by 1px in Firefox
* box-products, round-customers - clicking add - ok/cancel buttons jump right to left
* Customer phone has extra top margin on small screen
* Box products seems to think column widths are wider than they should be
* row details should have constant padding
* When cancel cc-numeric by pressing Escape and click to edit again, retains previously edited value
  (blur event fires when clicking on control to edit again, so thinks it was user input)
* Fix round-customers rendering
* cc-numeric is dodgy. Make this use ngModel somehow?

Ideas
=====
* Add warning message to guest user that data will not be kept
* Nicer error message when guest tries to send emails?
* Undo/redo
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Catch tabbing away in active-elements then handle it specifically as a tabbed-away event 
  in container components?

Tidy up
=======
* Rename editable-value-new, editable-value
* Add boxes.getAllWithProducts, change getAll to just return box data (BoxWithProducts override)

TODO (now)
==========
* Server-side api
* Errors when no more boxes/products available
* distribute-width should maybe use document selectors to set min-width (quicker?)
* Prices should be integers in pence, not floating point!!
* Select not pre-selecting first box after add, or first product after remove
* Select not updating box/product id after add (fk violation)
* When finished editing quantity, reverts back to old value before getting new value from server
