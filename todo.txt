General Styling
===============
* Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)

Edit Individual fields
======================
* Parent directive for row highlight
  - focused button should not be highlighted if hovering over another row
  - when editing, should not highlight other rows on hover
  - if button focused, should highlight row
* Add preview?
  - Only show add preview on new mouse over (i.e. shouldn't show after hitting cancel and mouse remains over add button)
  - If add button is focused, should we show add preview?
* Save/add behaviour
  - Server side/parent component logic for field changes
  - Field save success indicator
  - Field validation (multiple field coordination?)
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
* Select all in add mode, only on first focus within add action
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)
* On add, should scroll page to bring row being added into view
* keydown: Enter to save, Esc to cancel
* Component focus behaviour: encapsulate in directive
