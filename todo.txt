Header
======
* Header takes up too much space on small browser width
* Center alignment off on home page header
* Header/home/nav structure is messy
* Fix login form resizing/header centring
* Inline logo svg
* Change favicon

Editing
=======
* Fix numeric rounding issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10015027/javascript-tofixed-not-rounding

Auth
====
* Log out button slightly different on home page
* Redirect to original page on log in
* Implement JWT

Database
========
* Split out schema sql from data
* Implement sqlite backup strategy
* Better sqlite error handling (handle sql errors)
* Catch sql errors instead of crashing (uq violation)
  - handle in SqliteDb

Deployment
==========
* Hosting

General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)

Edit Individual fields
======================
* Save/add behaviour
  - Field save success indicator
  - Field validation (multiple field coordination?)
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
? Select all in add mode, only on first focus within add action
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)
* On add, should scroll page to bring row being added into view
* keydown: Enter to save, Esc to cancel
? Split out grab/highlight directives?
? Maybe add should show all fields in edit mode?
* Fix add focus - when should it stay in add mode?
* 1px wobble in product unit quantity
* Vertically centre 'edit' button
* Change background of 'edit' button on mouseover?
* Highlight/textbox border should be outside (encompass) icons on fields (address, email, tel)

Round customers
===============
* Erratic expand/collapse behaviour if add/remove customer enough times
* Move to postgres as sqlite not supported on Heroku?
* Subject & body should be mandatory email fields
* Should BCC recipients, not TO
* Add/remove button icons alignment out

BUGS!!!!
========
* Adding round didn't update page with new round (hitting enter on save button?)
* Deleting a round didn't update available customers, so couldn't add customers to new round
* (after add + cancel) Add row wasn't focused but other rows hover was as if it was focused
* Logout button not visible on small screen
* tsconfig watch: true - needed for dev but not for production - need to resolve this somehow.
* 401 (Unauthorized) exception breaking error notification - need to work out & handle all exception
  shapes
* Sometimes have to click login button twice.
* Click away from control in edit mode doesn't work first time (have to click twice)
* add/delete entity doesn't work (asnyc problems?) (sqlite)
* ref integrity issues in sqlite - allows references to deleted entity ids (check fk constraints?)
* missing identity constraint in postgres on id columns
* Permission denied in postgres kills server
* Add button should be on top of page too (auto scroll down to bottom)
