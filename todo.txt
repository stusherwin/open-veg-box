General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)

Edit Individual fields
======================
? Add preview?
  - Only show add preview on new mouse over (i.e. shouldn't show after hitting cancel and mouse remains over add button)
  - If add button is focused, should we show add preview?
* Save/add behaviour
  - Field save success indicator
  - Field validation (multiple field coordination?)
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
? Select all in add mode, only on first focus within add action
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)
* On add, should scroll page to bring row being added into view
* keydown: Enter to save, Esc to cancel

~* Why is BrowserSync reloading multiple times??
* Split out grab/highlight directives?
* Implement 'email all' feature on Round
? Maybe add should show all fields in edit mode?
* Fix add focus - when should it stay in add mode?
* Catch sql errors instead of crashing (uq violation)
  - handle in SqlHelper
* When round customer removed, should switch focus to next customer / add dropdown
* 1px wobble in product unit quantity
