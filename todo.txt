Header
======
* Header takes up too much space on small browser width
* Center alignment off on home page header
* Header/home/nav structure is messy
* Inline logo svg
* Change favicon

Auth
====
* Redirect to original page on log in
* Implement JWT

Database
========
* Split out schema sql from data
* Implement sqlite backup strategy
* Catch sql errors instead of crashing (uq violation)
  - handle in SqliteDb
* Hash/salt passwords in main db

Deployment
==========
* tsconfig watch: true - needed for dev but not for production - need to resolve this somehow.
* Set up mailgun to use production settings
* Set up SSL


General Styling
===============
? Buttons: circular shadow on hover instead of rectangle?
* Browser testing
* Chrome rendering issue with 1px border width (fix by positioning from centre of circles not corner)
* Logout button not visible on small screen
* when no round customers should show 'no customers assigned' message
* page footer

Editing
=======
* Fix numeric rounding issues: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10015027/javascript-tofixed-not-rounding
* Just show edit icon without dotted border
  - Vertically centre 'edit' button
  - 1px wobble in product unit quantity
* Highlight/textbox border should be outside (encompass) icons on fields (address, email, tel)
* Field save success indicator
* Field validation (multiple field coordination?)
* Figure out why clicking on page doesn't reset current tab index
  (sets it to delete button, tabindex=2, which is first element on page with tabindex, but subsequent elements
  have tabindex=1)
* keydown: Enter to save, Esc to cancel

Row save/add/delete
======================
* On delete, focus previous item delete button
? Select all in add mode, only on first focus within add action
* Animation (close row on delete, fade add preview in/out)
* On add, should scroll page to bring row being added into view
? Maybe add should show all fields in edit mode?

Round customers
===============
* Subject & body should be mandatory email fields
* Should BCC recipients, not TO
* Still some issues with tabbing into
  - sometimes flickers when tabbing into for first time
  - hitting enter when button focused sometimes closes entire control
  - sometimes misses entire row when tabbing away (tabs to following control on next row!)
    (seems to be after opening control with click, then tabbing around + finally clicking on a button)

BUGS!!!!
========
* Adding round didn't update page with new round (hitting enter on save button?)
* Deleting a round didn't update available customers, so couldn't add customers to new round
* Sometimes have to click login button twice.
* Add button should be on top of page too (auto scroll down to bottom)

Ideas
=====
* Add warning message to guest user that data will not be kept
* Nicer error message when guest tries to send emails?
* Undo/redo

Box Products
============
* Make rest of app consistent with edit highlight
* Better width solution than hardcoding pixel widths in code (padding/remainders)?
* Quantity format should reflect unittype?
* Column spacing - not enough between product name & quantity,
  too much between q & remove btn

Round customers
===============
* 1px spacing difference when tabbing into round-customers from outside
  - also within round-customers (add?)
* Adding last customer - add control is displayed then immediately hidden
* Removing last customer - add control hidden then displayed

* Catch tabbing away in active-elements then handle it specifically as a tabbed-away event 
  in container components?
* Add mode should not show ok/cancel buttons on each value control

Bugs
====
* Warning icon alignment out in Firefox
* Row highlight flashes when editable-value canceled
* box-product-quantity edit out by 1px in Firefox
* Product price fields out of alignment

Tidy up
=======
* Number parsing should be extracted as a component/directive
* page.less is a mess




Next steps
==========
* Fix alignment on product-price
* Make email subject/body mandatory
* Turn on mailgun production mode on heroku
* Remove experimental stuff on collection-points
* Delete -old components
* More padding between box-product-quantity and remove button
* Extract out number component? 
* Bring value updating behaviour into editable-value component

* Product price validation
